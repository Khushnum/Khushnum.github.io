<p>Every day dogs are abandoned by their owners for many reasons. They may not be able to look after the dogs for want of money to feed it,or because they do not have the time to take care of it. Large breeds are sometime taken up when they are puppies. Only when the dog grows up  does the owner realise the dog's need for space and freedom.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that not everyone loves animals. Ask any animal welfare officer about the animals who are found bruised, bloodied and emaciated; the litters of puppies who are rescued from taped-up boxes alongside highways or from sealed plastic garbage bags thrown into lakes and rivers; and the animals who are abandoned because they &quot bark too much &quot or are aging or because the family is moving.</p>
<p>There are many  Rescue Associations doing wonderful work in rescuing anything from mixed breeds to highly pedigreed dogs.</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we do to help?</li>
<p>Adopt from animal shelters or from the street – <u>NEVER</u> buy from a pet shop. And don’t forget about adult animals, who are often overlooked by people who are looking for a puppy.</p>
<li>Where can we help and adopt them instead of buying ?</li>
